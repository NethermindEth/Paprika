# :hot_pepper: Paprika

Paprika provides a custom implementation of the Patricia tree used in Ethereum. It aims at replacing the underlying storage as a solution on a higher level of abstraction.

## Design

Visit [docs](/docs) for all the design and implementation-specific information about Paprika.

## Benchmarks

After the redesign to be page-oriented, the benchmarks use bigger numbers

1. [160 million pairs](#160-millions-of-pairs), written in a single transaction, which shall simulate the initial population/sync

In each case, the key is 32 bytes long. The value is 32 bytes long as well.

### General considerations

#### Memory Profiling

Almost no managed memory is used

### 160 million pairs

Writing 160 million 32bytes -> 32bytes mappings

Writing of 160,000,000.00 items took 00:08:19.8204173 giving a throughput 320,114.00 items/s

Committing to disk took 00:00:10.4085680

Reading of 160,000,000.00 items took 00:08:24.8362414 giving a throughput 316,934.00 items/s
